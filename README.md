## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned in this challenge is how to approach the responsiveness of the website based on the screen size of a device. I also learned on how to manipulate different images in a single `div`, it can help in the future mini project of mine that will manipulate images not just in responsiveness of the website but also in the interactiveness of the website. 

### Continued development

What I want to highlight in this section is the application of techniques of the responsiveness of the website. Seems like `@media screen` is not the only way to change the design of the website. 

One of the examples is it can also be change by manipulating the `font` directly, for example is to calculate the font size by the screen size, though it is only based on what I read on the articles, as of now.
